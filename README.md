# TalentTalent

TalentTalent is a decentralized program for aggregating human skills in the form of digital business cards. The unique concept allows each user to gather skills within their network and connect with other individuals doing the same, creating a larger distributed decentralized database.

## Features

- **Personalized Collection**: Each user manages their own entries, keeping track of the skills and talents within their network.
- **Social Connectivity**: Connect with other skill collectors in other networks, sharing and growing your database with theirs.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Whenever there are changes or new entries, you can share the updated data with your connected friends.
- **Expiry System**: To ensure the database remains relevant, each entry has an expiration date to prevent orphan entries long term.
- **Exportability**: The entries can be exported in HTML format for easy printing or sharing via email with interested parties.
